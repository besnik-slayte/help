# Reviewing a Submission

In this article, you'll learn how to check for review assignments and complete a review for a submission.

An administrator assigns a submission to a reviewer, who will receive notice that a submission is ready for review. The reviewer logs into Slayte and navigates to the submisson, and completes a review form. The details for this workflow are given below.


## Check for review assignments

**Step 1** — Navigate to the Home page, then click the **Calls** button.
